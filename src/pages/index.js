        <h1>Welcome to my blog about happiness!</h1>
        <p>
          My name's Kate. I'm a software engineer with a passion for reading, hot chips and colourful clothes and personal development.
          Since I was 21 I've been struggling with depression. Not cripplingly so, but enough that my life was turning out to be somewhere between aggressively average and a bit of a bummer.
          This year I was like, you know what, fuck this. I'm sick of living so half heartedly, and of not feeling excited or passionate, when in reality I have a pretty great life.
          I decided that I was going to try everything I could to make myself happier, and along the way, learn to be kinder, more energentic and more accepting.
          This blog is my record of that journey.
