          Our brief was to design the UX and UI for a brewing company, with the goal of increasing signups for tours and workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by creating a persona to help me to understand my users needs, behaviours and goals.
          My persona, Simonâ€™s primary goal was to learn how to make his first homebrew in as few steps as possible.
          By designing an interface that encourages first time brewers to signup for a workshop I could meet both the business and my users goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I did a card sorting exercise from the perspective of my user.
          Card sorting is used to group bits of functionality that make sense together to get a better idea of how to organise the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly I created wireframes. These allow the functionality and layout to be refined separately from the branding, making the design faster to iterate on.
