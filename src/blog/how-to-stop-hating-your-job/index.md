Many of us want to quit our 9 to 5. We hate our office because it has no windows, or because of our grumpy manager, or that stress inducing project.

We spend 40 hours a week at this place, and we resent it. We dream of a future where the work is more interesting, challenging and better paid.

<h3>Because that would make us happy.</h3>

The problem is that this doesn't always work. We change jobs and we enjoy it for a while, then settle back into complaining about our co-workers. Or we work for ourselves and discover it can be even more stressful to be your own boss.

The issue is that we believe that our feelings are caused by our external circumstances, when in reality they are caused by our thoughts.

We don't hate our office because it's dingy and has no windows. We hate it because we have <b>DECIDED</b> that 'can't do my best work in a place like this!' or 'The reason I have this office is because my boss doesn't respect me'. We <b>DECIDE</b> that we <b>MUST HAVE</b> light and space, and when we don't get it we feel upset.

<h3>The problem with this is that you are giving the key to your happiness to something that you have no control over.</h3>

When your external circumstances dictate the way you feel and think it's easy to feel helpless.

So how do you stop hating your job? You forgot about the external circumstances and you fix your thinking. You DECIDE not to hate it.

What?! How the hell are you supposed to just stop hating something?

Let me give you an example.

When I first started working I didn't enjoy my job. When I was first started I found the work difficult and I was scared to ask for help too often in case I showcased my own stupidity. I spent a lot of time frustrated. I wasn't working with my preferred technology and thought about how much better that would be. I also work in a very quiet office, with a lot of introverts, and I was lonely. I thought as my job as 'skill building' for the future and told myself it didn't have to be fun, I would just endure it.

By the time I had been there 6 months I was pretty miserable. And no wonder!
I was spending 40 hours a week at a place I'd decided was boring, frustrating and lonely.

I believed that my misery was caused by the difficulty of the work, the technology, the quiet office, but in reality it was caused by my thinking. I was waking up every day telling myself I wasn't going to enjoy it. I was looking for things that would confirm this belief.

Our brains like to keep us efficient. They do so by making it easy and comfortable to think the same thoughts again and again. So if you always think negative thoughts your brain is going to optimise that process. It tries to help you, by creating a quick path way, but it ends up keeping you stuck thinking the same way.

I was deep in this cycle of negativity, when I realised that I had to change my attitude, or I had to quit. Not only were my beliefs not making me happy, they were making me a lazier and less motivated employee. Something had to give.

I made the choice to start being more positive. I cut myself off when I tried to complain. I looked for the best in projects I was bored by. When I got stressed I practiced managing it, and told myself I was was developing a useful skill.

My brain did not like this at first. It told me I was lying to myself.

And in some ways I was. I was telling myself a story.

<h3>But, my positive story was no more of a lie than my negative story had been.</h3>

Both of them were made up. The only thing that makes these stories real is how much you believe in them.

After a month or so with my new thinking habits my brain got used to them. It became easier to reach for positivity because that was my new normal.

And then something even better happened.

<h3>Once I was looking for the positive I started to see it everywhere.</h3>

I'd been missing out on seeing the kindness, generousity and intelligence of the people around me. And all because I was so invested in my own sob story.

It was like I'd been standing in a dark room and I'd finally turned on the light.

Today, I can honestly say I love my job. The work and the people have changed very little. My thinking has been completely overhauled.

This is not easy. You have to consciously work on your thinking and you have to do it everyday. Your brain will fight you on this. It will tell you that your circumstances are different, that it's too hard, that you're too busy. It will want you to give up because it's less work.

But if you could wake up everyday excited to go to work, if you could love your projects and co-workers, if you could even miss working (just a little bit) when you go on holiday, then wouldn't that be worth it?
