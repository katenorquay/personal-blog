<h3> 1. The Life Coach School with Brooke Castillo</h3>

It’s no secret that I am absolutely obsessed with this podcast. I talk about it every chance that I get. This is a podcast for those that are looking to upskill their mental health, and to feel better about themselves and their lives. It’s heavy on the practical skills, and you leave every episode feeling like you learned something important. Brooke has helped me to find so much joy in my life, by simply changing the ways that I think about it.

An episode that really blew my mind was #164 Love 2.0.
Brooke argues that love is always the best option, because love always feels amazing, and love always creates a good result. Unconditional love is one of the greatest skills that we can develop. This episode taught me to drop my expectations, to stop trying to change people so I would be able to love them, and to instead just decide to love them no matter what. This means that you can show up for the people in your lives, without judgement and get to love for exactly who they are. And, as an added bonus, this makes it much easier to love ourselves when we fail or mess up.

<h3> 2. Conversations With People Who Hate Me</h3>

This show is exactly what it sounds like. The host calls up people that have said cruel things about each other on the internet, and facilitates a conversation between them. Sometimes he calls people that hate him personally, and tries to gain some understanding into why.

I find the concept for this podcast beautiful. The host and guests take hatred, and petty internet comments, and turn them into a thought provoking conversation, which more often than not reveals how our similarities are greater than our differences. Dylan asks us to remember that there’s a person on the other end of the screen.

My favourite episode is Episode 21: Nauseating, a conversation with a college senior, who wrote an opinion piece referring to Dylan’s past work as nauseating.

<h3> 3. The Goal Digger Podcast with Jenna Kutcher</h3>

This podcast is a must for anyone that is interested in social media marketing, branding or photography. Jenna offers insightful tips to help you grow your business, but more than that she helps young entrepreneurs to believe in themselves. She is so honest and open with her listeners, taking us behind the scenes to her struggles with her body, and her miscarriages. You can’t help falling in love with her a little bit.

An episode I really enjoyed recently was #187: My Worst Client Experiences and What They Taught Me. We get to hear about the struggles Jenna faced on her way to building her empire, and truly see that no one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes.

<h3> 4. The Good Life Project</h3>

The Good Life Project is a podcast which presents you with stories and conversations to help you live your best life. The best thing about this podcast is its diversity, as each guest brings a completely different perspective on what it is to be happy. One week you can hear about the effects of psychedelic drugs on depression, and the next is about the power of expression through poetry.

I loved Jen Sincero’s episode: You Are a Badass at Life and Money. Jen’s journey from living, broke in a tiny garage to being a successful author is inspiring, and Jen herself is hilarious, which makes this episode such a fun listen.

<h3> 5. Optimal Daily Living</h3>

Optimal Daily Living is the perfect thing for those of us that prefer to listen to podcasts over reading blogs. Justin Malik narrates the best content on personal development, minimalism, health business and more. It’s a quick and easy listen, that saves you the time of searching for the best content online.
