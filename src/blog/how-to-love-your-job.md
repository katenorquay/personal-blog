How to love your job

It's easy to think that our love of something depends on our circumstances. If something is interesting and challenging and fun then it would be easy to love it. We search for something with these properties, and if we don't find it we complain about our circumstances.

Many of us hate our jobs. We love to think about quitting our 9-5, because then we'll find challenging work. We want to get away from that terrible manager or the stress of a project. The problem is that we believe that these external circumstances are the thing affecting the way we feel, when in reality we are choosing to think the negative thoughts. We are the only ones responsible for our happiness, we are the ones who decide what we enjoy and don't enjoy. So why wouldn't we just decide that we enjoy our jobs?

This is a challenging thought. What do you mean I can decide to enjoy it? But what about my terrible manager? What about my stress?

What about them?

Are those things so terrible that you are willing to double the pain by thinking about how terrible they are all the time?

When I first started working I didn't enjoy my job. I work as a software developer. When I was first starting I found the work difficult and I was too scared to ask for help in case I showcased my own stupidity. I spent a lot of time frustrated. I also wasn't working with my preferred technology and thought about how much better that would be. I also work in a very quiet office, with a lot of introverts and I felt isolated and lonely. When I was offered a 3 year contract I was conflicted. I didn't have much experience, and the chances of getting another job were low. So I took the job, even though I didn't believe I would really enjoy it. I thought of the new 3 year as my skill building years. They didn't have to be fun or challenging, I would just get through them.

By the time I had been there 6 months I was pretty miserable. And no wonder! If you decide that you're not going to have fun at the place you spend 40 hours a week at then you are setting yourself up for misery.

I decided that I needed an attitude adjustment. Not only were my beliefs not making me happy, they were making me a lazier and less motivated employee.

The trick to adjusting your attitude is to start small. If you try to go from I hate my job to I love my job you're not going to believe it. Instead tell yourself how much you enjoyed one small aspect of a project. Focus on that co worker who you enjoy the company of. If all you do is stress, practice managing that stress and tell yourself you're lucky to have a chance to do that.

We like to pretend this is harder than it is. We like to say that our circumstances are much harder than others and positive thinking is not possible. But it is always possible. When I was a college graduate who couldn't get a better job than McDonalds I used celebrate when the mustard made a smily face pattern when I squirted it on the bun. There is always something good, even if it's small. -->
