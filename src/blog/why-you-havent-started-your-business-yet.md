Why you haven't started your business yet.

I've been interested in starting a side hustle for a long time now. I'm a big fan of listening to business podcasts, and I've spent probably the last year learning all there is to know about creating content and facebook ads and instagram marketing. I got really excited about the idea of creating a blog. I got really excited. I created a couple of logos, wrote a blog post or two, then lost enthusiam. Who am I to talk about this? Why would anybody even care? I wouldn't publish, and I'd forgot about it and get lost in Netflix.

I've always framed this as procastination, or confusion, 'I don't know what to write about' kinda thing. The truth of it was I wasn't taking action, and it wasn't because I didn't know enough or that I was too lazy. I was because I was scared.

I saw a lot of posts and podcasts telling me that I needed to take action. That I was spending to much time trying to learn about the business, or to decide on a colour scheme, and what I really needed to do was just to create some content for christs sake. I agreed with this intellictually.But I'd always find myself staring at the blinking cursor and thinking I know that I'm supposed to take some action, but how do I do it? No one else seemed to have a problem with the how, they'd just sit down and start typing. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't actually take the first steps.

My problem that I was trying to force myself to work, and when I couldn't I would hate on myself. What I actually needed to do was address the reason that I wasn't working. This seems like such a simple concept. Why am I not doing it? But I think so often we get stuck on 'I didn't do it. I'm terrible' and never make the step towards change.

Today I was listening to Brooke Castillo's podcast. She asked us to think about what we think about. I sat down and wrote a couple of pages about what I think about. I thought about my thoughts on my attempts at starting a business. What came out was a bunch of complaining about how I procastate,and that I'm confused,but I started to hit on something real. I have a belief that if I started a business I would end up being successful. As long as I didn't actually start I couldn't fail, and that fantasy could remain intact. To fail would mean that I was a disappointment, stupid, not hard working enough, not likeable enough. I mean jeez, with thoughts like that no wonder I wouldn't start.

Eventually I had the thought 'What would it mean to have a successful business?' I was gob smacked with how quickly my brain replied 'it would mean you are good enough'. And there was the fear out on the table. I wanted to use business success as an indicator of how worthy I am as a person.

As soon as I saw that written down I could see the ridiculousness of it. A failed business would not make me less than. The only way I can feel good enough is to think and believe that I am good enough. Using an external success as a mark of your worth as a person is not only misguided, but it will actively prevent you from pursuing it, by loading it up with an unnecessary weight and value.

If you are stuck procastinating and over thinking all you need to do is to ask yourself why. You can't change this behaviour without addressing the reasons behind it. After 8 months of no action,
understanding and embracing my fear let me sit down and write this blog post.

Here are some starter questions to help you address your own fears.
