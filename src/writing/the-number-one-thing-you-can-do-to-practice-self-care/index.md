Recently I learned about a form of self-care that has absolutely changed my life. I believe that it is the most critical thing we can do to practice self love.

And it’s going to make some of you mad.

I believe that the best way you can love yourself is to learn how to forgive other people.

Stop rolling your eyes.

I know that this is a challenging thought. And that’s because the way we think about forgiveness so flawed.

So let’s start by asking, what is forgiveness? Or more importantly, what isn’t forgiveness?

Forgiveness is not thinking someone’s behaviour was acceptable.

Forgiveness is not saying that what happened to you was ok.

Forgiveness is not forgetting the past.

It is recognizing the humanity in the person that hurt you.

Trying to understand their situation, and to feel empathy.

Choosing love over revenge.

When we talk about forgiveness we say, 'He doesn’t deserve my forgiveness. He was so cruel.'
We talk about it as if it’s a gift that we give to someone. We believe that withholding love punishes the person that hurt us. We think that if we hate hard enough, or we are heartbroken, or upset, we can make the other person feel guilty.

We believe that our hatred can make them change.

But we can’t make them change. We can hate as hard as we like. The person we hate can laugh at us, they can disregard our feelings, they can hate us back. No matter what we do, we can’t change their behaviour. Only they can do that.

So when we hate someone, we aren’t changing them. The only thing that we are doing is feeling hatred.

And there’s nothing wrong with that. Except that hatred feels excruciating. It shrinks your world. It makes you act in ways that limit you. It hurts.

When you choose to hate someone, you are choosing a path that is causing your own unhappiness.

<h3>As much pain as that person you hate put you through, it is your hatred that makes sure that pain will continue.</h3>

I know this first hand. I was abused in my early twenties and I was so heartbroken and angry.
 I wished that I could take revenge. I wanted to make my attackers feel my pain. I wanted them to suffer the way I was suffering.

And the rage felt good for a little while. That righteous anger made me feel powerful, as if I was fighting back. It make me feel strong.

But slowly that hate morphed into anger at myself, and a doubt that there was anything good in the world. It made me incapable of seeing the good in the world. It made me want to give up.

My hatred never hurt the people that attacked me. But it broke my heart everyday.

That hatred was a poison that I am still working to suck out.

Choosing to hate and be angry doesn’t make you feel good.

Choosing to feel love and compassion feels amazing. When you choose to feel empathy towards the person that hurt you, and when you forgive, you are choosing to end your own suffering.

<h3>Don’t forgive because that person deserves it. Forgive because you deserve it.</h3>

This work isn’t easy, and it doesn’t happen overnight. I recommend that you read ‘The Book of Forgiving’ by Desmond Tutu and Mpho Tutu, which shows you how to walk the path of forgiveness.

They share their own journeys with us, and watching them choose to forgive, in the face of apartheid, and murder, and imaginable suffering is nothing short of astonishing.

To help you get started with forgiveness, here are a few ways to find compassion and empathy when you don’t think you can.

<ol>
  <li>
    1. Remember that every person came from circumstances that you don't understand. People that are hurt, hurt people.<br></br>
  </li>
  <li>
    2. Remember that every person was once innocent. No one was born cruel.<br></br>
  </li>
  <li>
    3. Know that if you were in that exact same circumstance, you may have done the same thing. You like to think that you wouldn’t have. And perhaps you wouldn’t. But there is no way you can know that with absolute certainty.<br></br>
  </li>
  <li>
    4. Think about how it must feel to be that person. When I think of my abuser, I imagine what it must feel like to hurt another person like this. They may feel guilt or pain and suffer in their own way. From here it is easy to be angry, and tell yourself they deserve that guilt. But instead, reach for compassion. Sit with their guilt and pain, and feel their suffering.<br></br>
    If you believe they don’t feel any guilt or pain, imagine that. Imagine hurting someone and not even caring. Being that cold must feel terrible. A life without compassion is a life half lived.
  </li>
</ol>

As you do this work, remember it is not about the person who hurt you, it’s not about what they did, or the suffering you felt.

This is about you. When you choosing love, you are choosing to stop the cycle of hatred. You are choosing to stop hurting yourself. Choose to forgive, because you don’t deserve to suffer for another day.

<h3>Forgive as an act of self-love.</h3>
