Why is finding time for fun so difficult? We’ve all got to do lists a mile long, and between trying to eat healthy, go to the gym, call our parents, be a good friend, climb that career ladder and BE PRODUCTIVE, it’s easy to forget about the things we enjoy. When we’re exhausted it’s just easier to sit down, re-watch How I Met Your Mother for the 8th time, and try not to question whether we’re even enjoying it.

But having fun should be the top of our list, purely because it makes our experience of being alive better. We all want to have lives full of laughter and joy, and having lots of fun is the best way to guarantee that.

Here are some starting points to help you get there:

<h3>1. Do something challenging</h3>

When you look back over the past year, what are the things that you remember?

 For me, it’s acting in a short film, making a bunch of new friends at a work conference, and telling someone I had a crush on that I liked him.

All of these things scared the crap out of me in some way. I was reluctant to get out of my comfort zone, and in many ways I would have preferred to stay home, away from the possibility of rejection or failure.

But when you deviate from your normal you create more excitement in your life. You create memories that you can look back on. You prevent the days from blending into one. Living a full life is the best way to have fun.

<h3>2. Do what you enjoyed as a child</h3>

Children are really smart. They just start doing things, purely for the fun of it. They don’t drag mountains of anxiety and self judgement into everything they do. They don’t worry if they’re being productive enough. They just play.

That’s why when you look back on what you loved doing as a kid, you can often find a clue into the activities that you really love.

For me, that was scrapbooking, making collages, and making up elaborate stories about my enormous collection of beanie babies.

I don’t feel the need to get out the beanie babies these days, but I have found that some of my greatest happiness comes from telling stories, writing and acting, and making really terrible art in my art journal.

<h3>3. Make Bad Art </h3>

The importance of making bad art is something I learned from Clinical Psychologist (and my mum!) Karen Nimmo. She believes that being creative is one of our greatest natural medicines.
Making stuff grounds us and gives us a sense of accomplishment.

So often we stop making things because we are ashamed. We don’t believe we are creative, or imaginative. We think that whatever we make will be BAD, and use that as an excuse to stop doing it.
I believe we all have a call to creativity, whether it’s through drawing and painting, or cooking, or writing, or coding, or rearranging the furniture. Whatever your medicine of choice is, do it. And if it’s bad? Who cares. You don’t have to show anyone. Make things for the love of it.

<h3> 4. Do something frivolous </h3>

Stop trying to be productive. Stop trying to convince yourself that you have fun when you play chess, and read classical novels (if that’s not true for you!). Know that it’s completely fine to read a trashy novel, go window shopping, play angry birds and buy useless trinkets from the op shop. You can spend your time doing anything you want. Stop taking it all so seriously.

<h3> 5. Do something by yourself.</h3>

Spending time alone is hugely underrated. You are the only person you are guaranteed to have a relationship with for your entire life. You might as well learn to enjoy your own company.

Go to the movies. Read a book in the park. Go to brunch alone and treat yourself to the big breakfast.

I think that when you can spend a Saturday night hanging out by yourself and have a truly fantastic time, you are really doing something right.

<h3> 6. Make a plan </h3>

When we plan things out, we get to enjoy not just the event itself, but build anticipation through the planning process. Before the event even happens we’ve experienced so much joy through the build up.

Next time you are planning a holiday, get excited about the process. Spend time on google, and figure out where you want to go, the food you want to eat, and the sites you want to see. It makes the trip run smoother, but it also prolongs the excitement you get from the holiday.

You can practice this on a smaller scale by planning an event with friends, planning the perfect birthday present, or even planning your outfit.

<h3> 7. Learn to love what is </h3>

What’s that one chore that you absolutely dread? For me it was cooking. I hated the whole process, from the grocery shopping to the dishes. But it’s pointless to spend time and energy hating something that you have to do.

I started ordering a food bag of recipes and groceries. Once the tedium of planning and shopping for food was out of the way, I was free to just concentrate on making the food. And I found that just that small change made me so much less resentful, and I started to enjoy cooking much more.

Find a way to have fun doing the things that you have to do. Whether it’s listening to podcasts on your commute, or making yourself a star chart, there’s always some way to get enjoyment from the process.
