Tuvalu is a small pacific island of approximately 11,000 people. It is likely to be one of the first parts of the world critically affected by sea level rise. Before Tuvalu is flooded, deep rooted crops will be destroyed by salt water pollution, and the frequency of violent storms will increase. When this happens, the people of Tuvalu will have to make a choice - migrate to a new country and adapt to a new culture, or drown with the island. Au Ko Tuvalu is an incredibly moving exploration of this choice.

Au Ko Tuvalu, focuses on three siblings, Fetau, Maleko and Lifa, as alongside their Aunty Fala they pack up their home, preparing for a move to New Zealand. They will sail for three days, before taking a plane into Auckland to begin a life so different from anything they have ever known.

Au Ko Tuvalu is the first show written by writer/director Tavita Nielsen-Mamea, a fact that I find astonishing. Usually Fringe Festival plays have a trademark shakiness, as new theatre makers find their voice. This is not the case with Au Ko Tuvalu. Nielsen-Mamea tackles some big themes - how does where we came from, and our culture define us? How do we move on when that is taken away from us? and he makes it look effortless. Nielsen-Mamea weaves these themes into beautiful, believable family scenes with a good dose of comedy. Au Ko Tuvalu is truly one of those shows that can make you laugh and cry in the space of an hour.

Cast, Malia ‘Ahovelo, Spencer PapaLi’i, Talia-Rae Mavaega and Bella Robertson are all a joy to watch. It’s not easy to perform convincingly as a family, but with moments of frustration and mockery, they pull it off. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic between PapaLi’i as Maleko, and Mavaega as Lifa. These performers have great chemistry together, and get the audience laughing alongside them.

We are also treated to the traditional dance and music of Tuvalu, Falete. An ensemble, lead by Nupaia Talake performs some beautiful numbers, which give us more insight both into the culture of Tuvalu, and the journeys of our main characters. The show closes with a poignant song which gives us a conclusion worthy of the rest of the show. 

I struggle to say anything negative about Au Ko Tuvalu, but if I were to offer a piece of constructive criticism, props could have been used in a more believable way. There is a moment when Maleko and Lifa are folding laundry together, but as they fold each piece they throw it back into the basket, only to be refolded. This drew me out of the scene, as I saw them as two actors, needing something to do with their hands, rather than a real brother and sister, trying to finish the task as quickly as possible.

Au Ko Tuvalu is a beautiful, funny, meaningful show that should not be missed. It’s heartbreaking that this show is most likely going to become a reality for the people of Tuvalu, as their island suffers the effects of global warming which they did not create. I am thankful for the chance to see a show with such an important message filled with so much heart and laughter.
