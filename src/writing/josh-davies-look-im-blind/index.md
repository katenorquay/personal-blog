Josh Davies grew up with no sight in his left eye and only 15 percent vision in his right eye. Now he’s making comedy about it. Josh Davies, Look! I’m Blind is a stand up comedy show about the awkward, frustrating and confusing aspects of being blind, most of which are caused not by the blindness itself, but by everyone else's reaction to it. ​

The show is the sweet spot in comedy that makes you laugh (and laugh a lot), while also making you think. If you like snarky, self-deprecating humour, paired with calls for accessibility (and who doesn’t?), Look! I’m Blind will be right up your alley.

The show’s  essence is a series of jokes about being blind. Its aim is to give audiences insight into what it’s like to grow up with a disability, and it achieves this in spades. Josh talks about his experiences growing up in Levin, being bullied about his glasses, and other kids ‘testing’ his blindness by pulling the finger and asking ‘how many fingers am I holding up?’ He takes us through his experience looking for work, and his struggles with WINZ. Josh has to bring a medical certificate in every 3 months to prove that he’s still blind. Even though we’re laughing alongside him, Josh makes a serious point. How broken is our benefit system? WINZ, what is going on???

Look! I’m Blind is still in development, as Josh finds his footing with Wellington audiences. Josh mentions that he is recording this performance, and every time the audience reacts with a lukewarm chuckle, he comments ‘ok that’s cut’ so he can listen back and perfect his show for the next crowd. This could have come off as unprofessional, but Josh has such a repertoire with the crowd that it integrates seamlessly with the show. These moments actually show how sensitive Josh is to his audience’s reactions, and how unfazed he is by his stumbles. He banters effortlessly with the audience, commenting things like ‘Oh, that joke kills in Auckland!’, or ‘Yeah, I hate that joke, like that you guys did too.’  I loved getting the chance to see a little into a comedian’s process and give him a chance to develop. This is what the Fringe Festival is about.
​
Josh Davies, Look! I’m Blind is well worth your time. Josh Davies is a talented comedian, and one to watch. Josh said early in the show that he tells jokes about being blind because ‘that’s all he’s got’, but it was clear to everyone in the audience that this is just the beginning. With his imagination and ability to read the audience, Josh has got a great career ahead of him.
