My mental health journey really started with podcasts. I've discovered so many new ideas, found passions, learned about myself, and felt a connection with others through listening to podcasts. All that, and you can listen to them while doing the dishes!

Here's my list of the best podcasts for personal development and mental health.

<h3> 1. The Life Coach School with Brooke Castillo</h3>

It’s no secret that I am obsessed with this podcast. This is for those that are looking to upskill their mental health, and to feel better about themselves and their lives. It’s heavy on the practical skills, and you leave every episode feeling like you learned something important.

An episode that really blew my mind was #164 Love 2.0. It's about we can intentionally develop unconditional love for everyone, and why doing so will improve our lives. This is an episode to listen to anytime you have argument with someone you love, or you find yourself nagging and nit picking at your significant other.

<h3> 2. Conversations With People Who Hate Me</h3>

This show is exactly what it sounds like. The host Dylan Marron calls up people that have said cruel things about each other on the internet, and facilitates a conversation between them. Sometimes he calls people that 'hate' him personally, and tries to gain some understanding into why.

I find this concept beautiful. Dylan and the guests take petty hurtful internet comments, and turn them into a thought provoking conversation, which more often than not reveals how our similarities are greater than our differences. Dylan asks us to “Remember, there’s a human on the other side of the screen.”

My favourite episode is Episode 21: Nauseating, a conversation with a college senior, who wrote an opinion piece referring to Dylan’s past work as nauseating.

<h3> 3. The Goal Digger Podcast with Jenna Kutcher</h3>

This podcast is a must for anyone that is interested in social media marketing, branding or photography. Jenna offers insightful tips to help you grow your business.

But the reason her podcast makes this list is her dedication to empowering women. From openly sharing her struggles with her body and her miscarriages, to her relentless enthusiam and love for her listeners, Jenna makes you believe that you can achieve any dream you set your mind to. Honestly, you can’t help falling in love with her a little bit.

An episode I really enjoyed recently was #187: My Worst Client Experiences and What They Taught Me. We get to hear about the struggles Jenna faced on her way to building her empire. It's relatable, and so refreshing to know that you're not the only one who makes mistakes.

<h3> 4. The Good Life Project</h3>

The Good Life Project is a podcast which presents you with stories and conversations to help you live your best life. The best thing about this podcast is its diversity, as each guest brings a completely different perspective on what it is to live a good life. One week you can hear about the effects of psychedelic drugs on depression, and the next is about the power of expression through poetry.

I loved Jen Sincero’s episode (28th May 2018) about her book You Are a Badass at Life and Money. Jen’s journey from living, broke in a tiny garage to being a successful author is inspiring, and Jen herself is hilarious, which makes this episode such a fun listen.

<h3> 5. Optimal Daily Living</h3>

Optimal Daily Living is the perfect thing for those of us that prefer to listen to podcasts over reading blogs. Justin Malik narrates the best content on personal development, minimalism, health business and more. It’s a quick and easy listen, that saves you the time of searching for the best content online.

There you have it! I hope that one of these podcasts makes its way into your earbuds this week. I promise you, it'll be worth it.
