I've been interested in starting a blog for a loooooong time. I have spent hours listening to business podcasts, researching online marketing and trawling pintrest for inspiration.

I'd absorb information and feel so excited. But when I sat down and tried to actually write something I'd feel apathetic. Why should I waste my time writing this? Will anybody even read it? Then I'd forget about it and lose myself in Netflix.

I saw so many posts and podcasts telling me that I needed to TAKE ACTION. I knew that I was spending too much time 'learning' and not enough 'producing'. But what I didn't understand was how to make myself actually do the work. No on else seemed to have a problem over coming their own apathy. These thoughts made me feel guilty and unworthy.

I talked about procrastination as if it was some force outside of my control. A natural instinct that I would have to battle if I ever wanted to achieve anything.

But the truth is the procrastinating is a choice that we make. If we feel apathetic, or lazy, or confused, it's not 'just because'. There is a thought that is causing that feeling.

I became curious about my own behaviour and eventually I stumbled onto the question: What would it mean if I had a successful blog? And on the other hand, what if it was a failure? What if no one ever read it! Or even worse, what if everyone I knew read, and hated it!

I discovered that I believed having a successful business it would mean that I was good enough. And to fail would mean that I was a disappointment, stupid, not likeable enough.

<h3>I wanted to use business success as an indicator of how worthy I am as a person.</h3>

So it turned out my procrastinating wasn't laziness, it was pure fear. Why would I ever actually publish a post if I saw it as a gamble of my self worth?

As soon as I saw my fear written down I could see its ridiculousness. This thought had been recking havoc in my subconscious and I'd never seen the pattern before.

A failed business would not make me less than. Using an external success as a mark of your worth as a person is not only misguided, but it will actively prevent you from pursuing it, by loading it up with an unnecessary weight and value.

If you are stuck procrastinating and over thinking all you need to do is to ask yourself why.

It sounds stupid. It sounds too simple. But procrastinating is not the complex problem we want to make it out to be. We are simply choosing not to act, in order to avoid thinking a particular thought, or feeling a particular feeling.

You can't change this behaviour without addressing the reasons behind it. I know this because after 8 months of no action, understanding and embracing my fear let me sit down and write this blog post.

<h3>Here's a quick start guide if you want to stop procrastinating:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>1.</b> Get curious about your behaviour. Why are you procrastinating? What would it mean if you failed? And what would it mean if you succeeded?
    <br><br>If your answer is 'I don't have time!', or 'I don't know what to do', or 'I need time to relax', then question why you are CHOOSING to think that. I have had every one of these thoughts. I believed them so I could let myself off the hook. So I could stay in my comfort zone.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>2.</b> Whatever your reasons for procrastinating, accept them. Show yourself some compassion. It doesn't matter how much time you have wasted in the past. Forgive yourself. Feeling guilty or beating yourself up is not going to help you stop procrastinating, it will make you feel apathetic and keep you stuck.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>3.</b> Decide to do the work. This doesn't have to be a big deal. If you want to start a blog promise yourself that you'll write 100 words a day. The size of the goal isn't important. Neither is the quality of the work. What is important is that you start thinking of yourself as a person that can keep a promise to themselves. A person that can stick to a habit.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>4.</b> Make it easy to do the work. Figure out what you need to do. Write it down. Don't allow yourself to become confused. Don't change your mind. Commit to what you are going to do, and commit to when you are going to do it.
    <br><br> It's easy to say 'I want to do some writing this week..' and then on Sunday night decide you're too tired. But when you say 'I'm going to write a blog on procrastination for 20 minutes, Thursday night at 8.30' it's a lot harder to wriggle out of it.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>5.</b> Rinse and repeat. Your brain is going to come up with new reasons to avoid doing this work. You are going to have new fears. You are going to fail sometimes. Be curious about why, forgive yourself, and set new goals.<br><br>
  </li>
</ul>

You owe it to yourself to dream big and to try.

You got this.
