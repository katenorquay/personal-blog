title: "Realesmart"
description: "Realesmart is a tool for calculating your potential return when you invest in a property. I built the frontend of this app in React. The main challenge was the complexity of the calculator form, as many fields were interdependent on each other. I used redux-form to simplify this. Realesmart was my first project working as the only frontend developer."
